- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheTrueCelt
- 👀 I’m interested in games, friends, the outdoors and being a good human.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to handle what life throws at me. Oh, you mean code... C# and Korean.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning code and a language since that works for both of those.
- 📫 How to reach me send me a message through Github.
